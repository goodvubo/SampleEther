What Foldable phone means to me is, More screen (s) in less space. This advantage can reach to the consumers with a handsome opportunity to attach with the reintroduction of an old invention. People now-a-days tend to use mobile phones more than computers. Computers are a heavier thing besides their pocket phones. If they get an opportunity to use more screens then they will take it very easily. And that is happening  day by day.

Foldable phones bring more screen real estate in the same device space. This opens up possibilities for applications in various sectors such as gaming, design, education industry etc.

More screen brings more productivity, allows more multitasking options. People can enjoy an experience closer to the desktop applications. Foldable phones are using almost all available space for screen. Even when folded, the device continues to display information on the front.

Apps adapted to foldable phones can facilitate multitasking just like a desktop pc. You can use a different app on each half of the screen; for example, YouTube on one and Twitter on another.

Foldable phone sales are growing day by day. And in the next few years I think this market will boom. If software developers are not ready to think about the possible market very seriously then they will miss the test of generation's pulse.
